             How to Install EmbeddedGNU

1. Install the GNU compiler.

If you have not already installed the GNU gcc compiler
for the 68hc11/68hc12 MPUs, then you must do this now.

Get the main distribution file from this site:
  http://www.gnu-m68hc11.org

After downloading the compiler, install the compiler on 
your computer. I normally install it into the default 
directory of C:\usr, but you can install it whereever 
you want. I like to use a short pathname for the 
install directory, so I don't like to install it under
C:\Program Files, like most other windows software.


2. Install EmbeddedGNU on your computer.

Make sure you extract the directory names when you 
perform the installation.

Now start EmbeddedGNU.


3. Filename Association.

When you first start EmbeddedGNU it will ask if you 
want to associate the filename extensions used by 
EmbeddedGNU with itself. This lets you double-click 
on a filename and the EmbeddedGNU will be launched to 
let you edit the file. The default option is to 
associate ".prj" with EmbeddedGNU. This is the main 
project filetype used by EmbeddedGNU. 

You can also choose to associate .c, .h, and .s files
with EmbeddedGNU if you want to.

WARNING: if you are on WinNT/Win2K/WinXp, then you must
be logged in as an administrator to use this option.

Press OK to continue.


4. COM Port Selection.

Now it asks if you want to select your COM port. 
Say Yes.  Pick your port in the dropdown box. It 
defaults to 9600 baud, which is normally correct.


5. Directories

Before you press OK, switch to the Directories tab 
in this dialog. (If you pressed OK before coming here,
then select "Options, Environment Options" to return
here.)

Specify the name of your GCC Bin directory, and the
full pathname of your make program. Then press OK.
