1.0 Introduction

This tool is as far as I know, the only graphical tool for 
adjusting fuzzy logic rules for the Motorola HC12 series of
microcontrollers.  This will let you draw your rules and get your
register settings for the HC12 in a quick manner.  It also lets 
you know when you are in an abnormal rule state such as when the 
slopes cross over each other.

2.0 Usage

The default rule shown is that one used as an example in the HC12
data book.  You can either type in the register settings from into 
the given tool bar or drag the graph points.

There are four points to drag.  The two squares at the bottom of 
the window slide their respective slope line.  The circles change 
their slope.  The cursor will change to let you know the possible 
actions.
 
You can copy either the register settings or the graph into the 
clipboard from the Edit menu selection.
 
3.0 Possible Extra Features

I have been thinking of doing the following for the next release
of RuleTwister.  
* creation of a whole rule set instead of just a rule
* making it an OLE Control for plugging into development environments
* slide bar at the bottom of the window giving rule output at 
  a specific input

Please let me know if you are interested.  Feedback
is very much valued.  Check the shareware's web site of
